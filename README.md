# Evaluation Tool

The final assignment for Codaiseur Academy was to build an Evaluation Tool for Teachers. The ExpressJS API also made as part of the assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/MokumJ/evaluation-tool-API)

## Features
- Algorithm part; As a teacher I can click a button to pick a 'random' student to ask a question. Not entirely random though: RED students get ~50% of the questions YELLOW students ~33%, and GREEN students ~17%.
- As a teacher I can sign in
- As a teacher I can see (and add) current classes (aka batches) and its students
- As a teacher I see the percentage of students evaluated green, yellow and red
